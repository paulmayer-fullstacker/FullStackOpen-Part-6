# Full Stack Open: Exercises for Part-6 - State Management

## Introduction:

Herewith my submission of the exercises required for Module 6. The module repo contains multiple projects, which address different aspects of state management.

---

## The Solution:

The solution consists of three distinct project files contained within my FullStackOpen-Part-6 repository:
- The unicafe-redux project introduces state management with Redux, through exercises 6.1 and 6.2.
- The redux-anecdotes project further explores state management with Redux, while refining the anecdotes application. It addresses the majority of the exercises from 6.3 to 6.19. 
- Finally the query-anecdotes project employs the React Query library in addressing exercises 6.20 to 6.24

The scripts have been judiciously commented with inline documentation. So, we will not indulge in further explanation. We will simply cover the bare minimum information required to run the project applications.

### Development Snapshots (Tags):

Tags have been used to take development snapshots and key milestones. The tags are:
- milestone/part6-exercises-6.1-6.8
- milestone/part6-exercises-6.9-6.13
- milestone/part6-exercises-6.14-6.19

Exercises 6.20-6.24 represent the final stages of development for the repo.

## Running the Apps:

Having drawn down the code, within each project, run npm install. This will install the dependencies listed within the package.json file.

Where application employ a json server (e.g.,  query-anecdotes), the server must be started before the main service. In a separate command line window, run: npm run server. Then, in a new command line window, run: npm run dev. Applications that do not interact with a server can simply be started with: npm run dev.

## Version Control

All three project files have been pushed to my GitHub repository at https://github.com/paulmayer-fullstacker/FullStackOpen-Part-6.
